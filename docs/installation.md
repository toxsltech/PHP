## Installation

The preferred way to install this BASE is through [script](http://192.168.10.21/common/scripts.git).
Make sure you place it in root of your htdocs .

To install script module

```
git clone http://192.168.10.21/common/scripts.git
```

To install yii2-admin-panel-rest

```
git clone http://git21.jiweb.in/yii2/yii2-admin-panel-rest-1392.git
```

To install submodules

```
bash ../scripts/clone-submodules.sh -l
```

If you have composer.json

```
composer install --prefer-dist 
```

If you need to update vendor again you can use followig command

```
composer update --prefer-dist --prefer-stable
```

To install database run this command

```
php console.php installer/install -du=admin -dp=admin@123
```

Remember if you run above command, your previous data will format completely. I recommend you to never run this command on live server.

If you face database credentials permission error, then run command php console.php installer/install -du admin -dp admin@123 in my case admin is my database username and admin@123 is my database password.

To install database for single module

```
php console.php installer/install/module -m="modulename"
```

Install default data using : 

``` 
php console.php clear/default
```

## Usage
Once setup is done you need to follow the final setup with the installer .

```
make sure you give READ/WRITE permission to your folder.
```
